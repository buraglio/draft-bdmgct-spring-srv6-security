1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] utilizing an IPv6 data plane is a
   source routing model that leverages an IPv6 underlay and an IPv6
   extension header called the Segment Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8754] to
   signal and control the forwarding and path of packets by imposing an
   ordered list of segments that are processed at each hop along the
   signaled path.  SRv6 is fundamentally bound to the IPv6 protocol and
   introduces a new extension header.  There are security considerations
   which must be noted or addressed in order to operate an SRv6 network
   in a reliable and secure manner.  Specifically, some primary
   properties of SRv6 that affect the security considerations are:

   *  SRv6 may use the SRH which is a type of Routing Extension Header
      defined by [RFC8754].  Security considerations of the SRH are
      discussed [RFC8754] section 7, and were based in part on security
      considerations of the deprecated routing header 0 as discussed in
      [RFC5095] section 5.

   *  SRv6 uses the IPv6 data-plane, and therefore security
      considerations of IPv6 are applicable to SRv6 as well.  Some of
      these considerations are discussed in Section 10 of [RFC8200] and
      in [RFC9099].

   *  While SRv6 uses what appear to be typical IPv6 addresses, the
      address space is processed differently by segment endpoints.  A
      typical IPv6 unicast address is comprised of a network prefix,
      host identifier.  A typical SRv6 segment identifier (SID) is
      comprised of a locator, a function identifier, and optionally,
      function arguments.  The locator must be routable, which enables
      both SRv6 capable and incapable devices to participate in
      forwarding, either as normal IPv6 unicast or SRv6 segment
      endpoints.  The capability to operate in environments that may
      have gaps in SRv6 support allows the bridging of islands of SRv6
      devices with standard IPv6 unicast routing.

   This document describes various threats to SRv6 networks and also
   presents existing approaches to avoid or mitigate the threats.

2.  Scope of this Document

4.  Threat Terminology

   This section introduces the threat taxonomy that is used in this
   document, based on terminology from the Internet threat model
   [RFC3552], as well as some concepts from [RFC9055], [RFC7384],
   [RFC7835] and [RFC9416].  Details regarding inter-domain segment
   routing (SR) are out of scope for this document.

   Internal vs. External:  An internal attacker in the context of SRv6
      is an attacker who is located within an SR domain.  Specifically,
      an internal attacker either has access to a node in the SR domain,
      or is located such that it can send and receive packets to and
      from a node in the SR domain without traversing an SR ingress node
      or an SR egress node.  External attackers, on the other hand, are
      not within the SR domain.

   On-path vs. Off-path:  On-path attackers are located in a position
      that allows interception, modification or dropping of in-flight
      packets, as well as insertion (generation) of packets.  Off-path
      attackers can only attack by insertion of packets.

   Data plane vs. control plane vs. Management plane:  Attacks can be
      classified based on the plane they target: data, control, or
      management.  The distinction between on-path and off-path
      attackers depends on the plane where the attack occurs.  For
      instance, an attacker might be off-path from a data plane
      perspective but on-path from a control plane perspective.

   The following figure depicts an example of an SR domain with five
   attacker types, labeled 1-5.  For instance, attacker 2 is located
   along the path between the SR ingress node and SR endpoint 1, and is
   therefore an on-path attacker both in the data plane and in the
   control plane.  Thus, attacker 2 can listen, insert, delete, modify
   or replay data plane and/or control plane packets in transit.  Off-
   path attackers, such as attackers 4 and 5, can insert packets, and in
   some cases can passively listen to some traffic, such as multicast
   transmissions.  In this example a Path Computation Element as a
   Central Controller (PCECC) [RFC9050] is used as part of the control
   plane.  Thus, attacker 3 is an internal on-path attacker in the
   control plane, as it is located along the path between the PCECC and
   SR endpoint 1.

              node                                       node

                   Figure 1: Threat Model Taxonomy

   As defined in [RFC8402], SR operates within a "trusted domain".
   Therefore, in the current threat model the SR domain defines the
   boundary that distinguishes internal from external threats.
   Specifically, an attack on one domain that is invoked from within a
   different domain is considered an external attack in the context of
   the current document.

5.  Impact

   One of the important aspects of a threat analysis is the potential
   impact of each threat.  SRv6 allows for the forwarding of IPv6
   packets via predetermined SR policies, which determine the paths and
   the processing of these packets.  An attack on SRv6 may cause packets
   to traverse arbitrary paths and to be subject to arbitrary processing
   by SR endpoints within an SR domain.  This may allow an attacker to
   perform a number of attacks on the victim networks and hosts that
   would be mostly unfeasible for a non-SRv6 environment.

   The threat model in [ANSI-Sec] classifies threats according to their
   potential impact, defining six categories.  For each of these
   categories we briefly discuss its applicability to SRv6 attacks.

   *  Unauthorized Access: an attack that results in unauthorized access
      might be achieved by having an attacker leverage SRv6 to
      circumvent security controls as a result of security devices being
      unable to enforce security policies.  For example, this can occur
      if packets are directed through paths where packet filtering
      policies are not enforced, or if some security policies are not
      enforced in the presence of IPv6 Extension Headers.

   *  Masquerade: various attacks that result in spoofing or
      masquerading are possible in IPv6 networks.  However, these
      attacks are not specific to SRv6, and are therefore not within the
      scope of this document.

   *  System Integrity: attacks on SRv6 can manipulate the path and the
      processing that the packet is subject to, thus compromising the
      integrity of the system.  Furthermore, an attack that compromises
      the control plane and/or the management plane is also a means of
      impacting the system integrity.  Specific SRv6-targeted attack may
      cause one or more of the following outcomes:

      -  Avoiding a specific node or path: when an SRv6 policy is
         manipulated, specific nodes or paths may be bypassed, for
         example in order to bypass the billing service or avoid access
         controls and security filters.

      -  Preferring a specific path: packets can be manipulated so that
         they are diverted to a specific path.  This can result in
         allowing various unauthorized services such as traffic
         acceleration.  Alternatively, an attacker can divert traffic to
         be forwarded through a specific node that the attacker has
         access to, thus facilitating more complex on-path attacks such
         as passive listening, recon and various man-in-the-middle
         attacks.

      -  Causing header modifications: SRv6 network programming
         determines the SR endpoint behavior, including potential header
         modifications.  Thus, one of the potential outcomes of an
         attack is unwanted header modifications.

   *  Communication Integrity: SRv6 attacks may cause packets to be
      forwarded through paths that the attacker controls, which may
      facilitate other attacks that compromise the integrity of user
      data.  Integrity protection of user data, which is implemented in
      higher layers, avoids these aspects, and therefore communication
      integrity is not within the scope of this document.

   *  Confidentiality: as in communication integrity, packets forwarded
      through unintended paths may traverse nodes controlled by the
      attacker.  Since eavesdropping of user data can be avoided by
      using encryption in higher layers, it is not within the scope of
      this document.  However, eavesdropping of a network that uses SRv6
      allows the attacker to collect information about SR endpoint
      addresses, SR policies, and network topologies, is a specific form
      of reconnaissance

   *  Denial of Service: the availability aspects of SRv6 include the
      ability of attackers to leverage SRv6 as a means for compromising
      the performance of a network or for causing Denial of Service
      (DoS), including:

      -  Resource exhaustion: compromising the availability of the
         system can be achieved by sending SRv6-enabled packets to/
         through victim nodes in a way that results in a negative
         performance impact of the victim systems (e.g., [RFC9098]).
         For example, network programming can be used in some cases to
         manipulate segment endpoints to perform unnecessary functions
         that consume processing resources.  Resource exhaustion may in
         severe cases cause Denial of Service (DoS).

      -  Forwarding loops: an attacker might achieve attack
         amplification by increasing the number hops that each packet is
         forwarded through and thus increase the load on the network.
         For example, a set of SIDs can be inserted in a way that
         creates a forwarding loop ([RFC8402], [RFC5095],
         [CanSecWest2007]) and thus loads the nodes along the loop.

      -  Causing packets to be discarded: an attacker may cause a packet
         to be forwarded to a point in the network where it can no
         longer be forwarded, causing the packet to be discarded.

   Section 6 discusses specific implementations of these attacks, and
   possible mitigations are discussed in Section 7.

6.  Attacks

6.1.  Attack Abstractions

   Packet manipulation and processing attacks can be implemented by
   performing a set of one or more basic operations.  These basic
   operations (abstractions) are as follows:

   *  Passive listening: an attacker who reads packets off the network
      can collect information about SR endpoint addresses, SR policies
      and the network topology.  This information can then be used to
      deploy other types of attacks.

   *  Packet replaying: in a replay attack the attacker records one or
      more packets and transmits them at a later point in time.

   *  Packet insertion: an attacker generates and injects a packet to
      the network.  The generated packet may be maliciously crafted to
      include false information, including for example false addresses
      and SRv6-related information.

   *  Packet deletion: by intercepting and removing packets from the
      network, an attacker prevents these packets from reaching their
      destination.  Selective removal of packets may, in some cases,
      cause more severe damage than random packet loss.

   *  Packet modification: the attacker modifies packets during transit.

   This section describes attacks that are based on packet manipulation
   and processing, as well as attacks performed by other means.  While
   it is possible for packet manipulation and processing attacks against
   all the fields of the IPv6 header and its extension headers, this
   document limits itself to the IPv6 header and the SRH.

6.2.  Modification Attack

6.2.1.  Overview

   An on-path internal attacker can modify a packet while it is in
   transit in a way that directly affects the packet's segment list.

   A modification attack can be performed in one or more of the
   following ways:

   *  SID list: the SRH can be manipulated by adding or removing SIDs,
      or by modifying existing SIDs.

   *  IPv6 Destination Address (DA): when an SRH is present modifying
      the destination address (DA) of the IPv6 header affects the active
      segment.  However, DA modification can affect the SR policy even
      in the absence of an SRH.  One example is modifying a DA which is
      used as a Binding SID [RFC8402].  Another example is modifying a
      DA which represents a compressed segment list
      [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-srh-compression].  SRH compression allows
      encoding multiple compressed SIDs within a single 128-bit SID, and
      thus modifying the DA can affect one or more hops in the SR
      policy.

   *  Add/remove SRH: an attacker can insert or remove an SRH.

   *  SRH TLV: adding, removing or modifying TLV fields in the SRH.

   It is noted that the SR modification attack is performed by an on-
   path attacker who has access to packets in transit, and thus can
   implement these attacks directly.  However, SR modification is
   relatively easy to implement and requires low processing resources by
   an attacker, while it facilitates more complex on-path attacks by
   averting the traffic to another node that the attacker has access to
   and has more processing resources.

   An on-path internal attacker can also modify, insert or delete other
   extension headers but these are outside the scope of this document.

6.2.2.  Scope

   An SR modification attack can be performed by on-path attackers.  If
   filtering is deployed at the domain boundaries as described in
   Section 7.1, the ability to implement SR modification attacks is
   limited to on-path internal attackers.

6.2.3.  Impact

   SR modification attacks, including adding/removing an SRH, modifying
   the SID list and modifying the IPv6 DA, can have one or more of the
   following outcomes, which are described in Section 5.

   *  Unauthorized access

   *  Avoiding a specific node or path

   *  Preferring a specific path

   *  Causing header modifications

   *  Causing packets to be discarded

   *  Resource exhaustion

   *  Forwarding loops

   Maliciously adding unnecessary TLV fields can cause further resource
   exhaustion.

6.3.  Passive Listening

6.3.1.  Overview

   An on-path internal attacker can passively listen to packets and
   specifically listen to the SRv6-related information that is conveyed
   in the IPv6 header and the SRH.  This approach can be used for
   reconnaissance, i.e., for collecting segment lists.

6.3.2.  Scope

   A reconnaisance attack is limited to on-path internal attackers.

   If filtering is deployed at the domain boundaries (Section 7.1), it
   prevents any leaks of explicit SRv6 routing information through the
   boundaries of the administrative domain.  In this case external
   attackers can only collect SRv6-related data in a malfunctioning
   network in which SRv6-related information is leaked through the
   boundaries of an SR domain.

6.3.3.  Impact

   While the information collected in a reconnaisance attack does not
   compromise the confidentiality of the user data, it allows an
   attacker to gather information about the network which in turn can be
   used to enable other attacks.

6.4.  Packet Insertion

6.4.1.  Overview

   In a packet insertion attack packets are inserted (injected) into the
   network with a segment list.  The attack can be applied either by
   using synthetic packets or by replaying previously recorded packets.

6.4.2.  Scope

   Packet insertion can be performed by either on-path or off-path
   attackers.  In the case of a replay attack, recording packets in-
   flight requires on-path access and the recorded packets can later be
   injected either from an on-path or an off-path location.

   If filtering is deployed at the domain boundaries (Section 7.1),
   insertion attacks can only be implemented by internal attackers.

6.4.3.  Impact

   The main impact of this attack is resource exhaustion which
   compromises the availability of the network, as described in
   Section 6.2.3.

6.5.  Control and Management Plane Attacks

6.5.1.  Overview

   Depending on the control plane protocols used in a network, it is
   possible to use the control plane as a way of compromising the
   network.  For example, an attacker can advertise SIDs in order to
   manipulate the SR policies used in the network.  Known IPv6 control
   plane attacks (e.g., overclaiming) are applicable to SRv6 as well.

   A compromised management plane can also facilitate a wide range of
   attacks, including manipulating the SR policies or compromising the
   network availability.

6.5.2.  Scope

   The control plane and management plane may be either in-band or out-
   of-band, and thus the on-path and off-path taxonomy of Section 4 is
   not necessarily common between the data plane, control plane and
   management plane.  As in the data plane, on-path attackers can be
   implement a wide range of attacks in order to compromise the control
   and/or management plane, including selectively removing legitimate
   messages, replaying them or passively listening to them.  However,
   while an on-path attacker in the data plane is potentially more
   harmful than an off-path attacker, effective control and/or
   management plane attacks can be implemented off-path rather than by
   trying to intercept or modify traffic in-flight, for example by
   exchanging malicious control plane messages with legitimate routers,
   by spoofing an SDN (Software Defined Network) controller, or by
   gaining access to an NMS (Network Management System).

   SRv6 domain boundary filtering can be used for mitigating potential
   control plane and management plane attacks from external attackers.
   Segment routing does not define any specific security mechanisms in
   existing control plane or management plane protocols.  However,
   existing control plane and management plane protocols use
   authentication and security mechanisms to validate the authenticity
   of information.

6.5.3.  Impact

   A compromised control plane or management plane can impact the
   network in various possible ways.  SR policies can be manipulated by
   the attacker to avoid specific paths or to prefer specific paths, as
   described in Section 6.2.3.  Alternatively, the attacker can
   compromise the availability, either by defining SR policies that load
   the network resources, as described in Section 6.2.3, or by
   blackholing some or all of the SR policies.  A passive attacker can
   use the control plane or management plane messages as a means for
   recon, similarly to Section 6.2.3.

6.6.  Other Attacks

   Various attacks which are not specific to SRv6 can be used to
   compromise networks that deploy SRv6.  For example, spoofing is not
   specific to SRv6, but can be used in a network that uses SRv6.  Such
   attacks are outside the scope of this document.

   Because SRv6 is completely reliant on IPv6 for addressing,
   forwarding, and fundamental networking basics, it is potentially
   subject to any existing or emerging IPv6 vulnerabilities [RFC9099],
   however, this is out of scope for this document.

7.  Mitigation Methods

   This section presents methods that can be used to mitigate the
   threats and issues that were presented in previous sections.  This
   section does not introduce new security solutions or protocols.

7.1.  Trusted Domains and Filtering

7.1.1.  Overview

   As specified in [RFC8402]:

    By default, SR operates within a trusted domain.  Traffic MUST be
    filtered at the domain boundaries.
    The use of best practices to reduce the risk of tampering within the
    trusted domain is important.  Such practices are discussed in
    [RFC4381] and are applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6.

   Following the spirit of [RFC8402], the current document assumes that
   SRv6 is deployed within a trusted domain.  Traffic MUST be filtered
   at the domain boundaries.  Thus, most of the attacks described in
   this document are limited to within the domain (i.e., internal
   attackers).

   Such an approach has been commonly referred to as the concept of
   "fail-open", a state of which the attributes are frequently described
   as containing inherently more risk than fail-closed methodologies.
   The reliance of perfectly crafted filters on on all edges of the
   trusted domain, noting that if the filters are removed or adjusted in
   an erroneous manner, there is a demonstrable risk of inbound or
   outbound leaks.  It is also important to note that some filtering
   implementations have limits on the size, complexity, or protocol
   support that can be applied, which may prevent the filter adjustments
   or creation required to properly secure the trusted domain for a new
   protocol such as SRv6.

   Practically speaking, this means successfully enforcing a "Trusted
   Domain" may be operationally difficult and error-prone in practice,
   and that attacks that are expected to be unfeasible from outside the
   Trusted Domain may actually become feasible when any of the involved
   systems fails to enforce the filtering policy that is required to
   define the Trusted Domain.

7.1.2.  SRH Filtering

   Filtering on presence of an SRH is possible but not useful for two
   reasons: 1.  The SRH is optional for SID processing as described in
   [RFC8754] section 3.1 and 4.1. 2.  A packet containing an SRH may not
   be destined to the SR domain, it may be simply transiting the domain.

   For these reasons SRH filtering is not a useful method of mitigation,
   and thus filtering can only be applied based on the address range, as
   described below.

7.1.3.  Address Range Filtering

   The IPv6 destination address can be filtered at the SR ingress node
   and at all nodes implementing SRv6 SIDs within the SR domain in order
   to mitigate external attacks.  Section 5.1 of [RFC8754] describes
   this in detail, it's summarized here as: 1.  At ingress nodes, any
   packet entering the SR domain and destined to a SID within the SR
   domain is dropped. 2.  At every SRv6 enabled node, any packet
   destined to a SID instantiated at the node from a source address
   outside the SR domain is dropped.

   In order to apply such a filtering mechanism the SR domain needs to
   have an infrastructure address range for SIDs, and an infrastructure
   address range for source addresses, that can be detected and
   enforced.  Some examples of an infrastructure address range for SIDs
   are: 1.  ULA addresses 2.  The prefix defined in [RFC9602]. 3.  GUA
   addresses

   Many operators reserve a /64 block for all loopback addresses and
   allocate /128 for each loopback interface.  This simplifies the
   filtering of permitted source addresses.

   Failure to implement address range filtering at ingress nodes is
   mitigated with filtering at SRv6 enabled node.  Failure to implement
   both filtering mechanisms could result in a "fail open" scenario,
   where some attacks by internal attackers described in this document
   may be launched by external attackers.

7.2.  Encapsulation of Packets

   Packets steered in an SR domain are often encapsulated in an IPv6
   encapsulation.  This mechanism allows for encapsulation of both IPv4
   and IPv6 packets.  Encapsulation of packets at the SR ingress node
   and decapsulation at the SR egress node mitigates the ability of
   external attackers to attack the domain.

7.3.  Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)

   The SRH can be secured by an HMAC TLV, as defined in [RFC8754].  The
   HMAC is an optional TLV that secures the segment list, the SRH flags,
   the SRH Last Entry field and the IPv6 source address.  A pre-shared
   key is used in the generation and verification of the HMAC.

   Using an HMAC in an SR domain can mitigate some of the SR
   Modification Attacks (Section 6.2).  For example, the segment list is
   protected by the HMAC.

   The following aspects of the HMAC should be considered:

   *  The HMAC TLV is OPTIONAL.

   *  While it is presumed that unique keys will be employed by each
      participating node, in scenarios where the network resorts to
      manual configuration of pre-shared keys, the same key might be
      reused by multiple systems as an (incorrect) shortcut to keeping
      the problem of pre-shared key configuration manageable.

   *  When the HMAC is used there is a distinction between an attacker
      who becomes internal by having physical access, for example by
      plugging into an active port of a network device, and an attacker
      who has full access to a legitimate network node, including for
      example encryption keys if the network is encrypted.  The latter
      type of attacker is an internal attacker who can perform any of
      the attacks that were described in the previous section as
      relevant to internal attackers.

   *  An internal attacker who does not have access to the pre-shared
      key can capture legitimate packets, and later replay the SRH and
      HMAC from these recorded packets.  This allows the attacker to
      insert the previously recorded SRH and HMAC into a newly injected
      packet.  An on-path internal attacker can also replace the SRH of
      an in-transit packet with a different SRH that was previously
      captured.

   These considerations limit the extent to which HMAC TLV can be relied
   upon as a security mechanism that could readily mitigate threats
   associated with spoofing and tampering protection for the IPv6 SRH.

8.  Implications on Existing Equipment

8.1.  Limitations in Filtering Capabilities

   [RFC9288] provides recommendations on the filtering of IPv6 packets
   containing IPv6 extension headers at transit routers.  However, this
   class of filtering is shown to not be useful and can be ignored.

   Filtering on prefixes has been shown to be useful, specifically
   [RFC8754]'s description of packet filtering.  There are no known
   limitations with filtering on infrastructure addresses, and [RFC9099]
   expands on the concept with control plane filtering.

8.2.  Middlebox Filtering Issues

   When an SRv6 packet is forwarded in the SRv6 domain, its destination
   address changes constantly, the real destination address is hidden.
   Security devices on SRv6 network may not learn the real destination
   address and fail to perform access control on some SRv6 traffic.

   The security devices on SRv6 networks need to take care of SRv6
   packets.  However, the SRv6 packets usually use loopback address of
   the PE device as a source address.  As a result, the address
   information of SR packets may be asymmetric, resulting in improper
   traffic filter problems, which affects the effectiveness of security
   devices.  For example, along the forwarding path in SRv6 network, the
   SR-aware firewall will check the association relationships of the
   bidirectional VPN traffic packets.  And it is able to retrieve the
   final destination of SRv6 packet from the last entry in the SRH.
   When the <source, destination> tuple of the packet from PE1 to PE2 is
   <PE1-IP-ADDR, PE2-VPN-SID>, and the other direction is <PE2-IP-ADDR,
   PE1-VPN-SID>, the source address and destination address of the
   forward and backward VPN traffic are regarded as different flows.
   Eventually, the legal traffic may be blocked by the firewall.

   SRv6 is commonly used as a tunneling technology in operator networks.
   To provide VPN service in an SRv6 network, the ingress PE
   encapsulates the payload with an outer IPv6 header with the SRH
   carrying the SR Policy segment list along with the VPN service SID.
   The user traffic towards SRv6 provider backbone will be encapsulated
   an SRv6 tunnel.  When constructing an SRv6 packet, the destination
   address field of the SRv6 packet changes constantly and the source
   address field of the SRv6 packet is usually assigned using an address
   on the originating device, which may be a host or a network element
   depending on configuration.  This may affect the security equipment
   and middle boxes in the traffic path.  Because of the existence of
   the SRH, and the additional headers, security appliances, monitoring
   systems, and middle boxes could react in different ways if they do
   not incorporate support for the supporting SRv6 mechanisms, such as
   the IPv6 Segment Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8754].  Additionally,
   implementation limitations in the processing of IPv6 packets with
   extension headers may result in SRv6 packets being dropped
   [RFC7872],[RFC9098].

8.3.  Limited capability hardware

   In some cases, access control list capabilities are a resource shared
   with other features across a given hardware platform.  Filtering
   capabilities should be considered along with other hardware reliant
   functions such as VLAN scale, route table size, MAC address table
   size, etc.  Filtering both at the control and data plane may or may
   not require shared resources.  For example, some platforms may
   require allocating resources from route table size in order to
   accommodate larger numbers of access lists.  Hardware and software
   configurations should be considered when designing the filtering
   capabilities for an SRv6 control and data plane.

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of SRv6 are presented throughout this
   document.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

11.  Topics for Further Consideration

   This section lists topics that will be discussed further before
   deciding whether they need to be included in this document, as well
   as some placeholders for items that need further work.

   *  Add tables for attack section

   *  The following references may be used in the future: RFC9256
      [RFC8986]

   *  SRH compression

   *  Spoofing

   *  Path enumeration

   *  host to host scenario involving a WAN and/or a data center fabric.

   *  Terms that may be used in a future version: Locator Block, FRR,
      uSID

   *  L4 checksum: [RFC8200] specifies that when the Routing header is
      present the L4 checksum is computed by the originating node based
      on the IPv6 address of the last element of the Routing header.
      When compressed segment lists
      [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-srh-compression] are used, the last element
      of the Routing header may be different than the Destination
      Address as received by the final destination.  Furthermore,
      compressed segment lists can be used in the Destination Address
      without the presence of a Routing header, and in this case the
      IPv6 Destination address can be modified along the path.  As a
      result, some existing middleboxes which verify the L4 checksum
      might miscalculate the checksum.  This issue is currently under
      discussion in the SPRING WG.

   *  Segment Routing Header figure: the SRv6 Segment Routing Header
      (SRH) is defined in [RFC8754].
