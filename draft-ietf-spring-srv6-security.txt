1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] utilizing an IPv6 data plane is a
   source routing model that leverages an IPv6 underlay and an IPv6
   extension header called the Segment Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8754].
   This header is used to signal and control the forwarding and path of
   packets by imposing an ordered list of segments that are processed at
   each hop along the signaled path.  SRv6 is fundamentally bound to the
   IPv6 protocol and introduces the aforementioned new extension header.
   There are security considerations which must be noted or addressed in
   order to operate an SRv6 network in a reliable and secure manner.
   Specifically, some primary properties of SRv6 that affect the
   security considerations are:

   *  SRv6 may use the SRH which is a type of Routing Extension Header
      defined by [RFC8754].  Security considerations of the SRH are
      discussed in [RFC8754] section 7, and were based in part on
      security considerations of the deprecated routing header 0 as
      discussed in [RFC5095] section 5.

   *  SRv6 uses the IPv6 data-plane, and therefore security
      considerations of IPv6 are applicable to SRv6 as well.  Some of
      these considerations are discussed in Section 10 of [RFC8200] and
      in [RFC9099].

   *  While SRv6 uses what appear to be typical IPv6 addresses, the
      address space is processed differently by segment endpoints.  A
      typical IPv6 unicast address is comprised of a network prefix and
      a host identifier.  A typical SRv6 segment identifier (SID) is
      comprised of a locator, a function identifier, and optionally,
      function arguments.  The locator must be routable, which enables
      both SRv6 capable and incapable devices to participate in
      forwarding, either as normal IPv6 unicast or SRv6 segment
      endpoints.  The capability to operate in environments that may
      have gaps in SRv6 support allows the bridging of islands of SRv6
      devices with standard IPv6 unicast routing.

   This document describes various threats to SRv6 networks and also
   presents existing approaches to avoid or mitigate the threats.

2.  Scope of this Document

   The following IETF RFCs were selected for security assessment as part
   of this effort:

4.  Threat Terminology

   This section introduces the threat taxonomy that is used in this
   document.  This taxonomy is based on terminology from the Internet
   threat model [RFC3552], as well as some concepts from [RFC9055],
   [RFC7384], [RFC7835] and [RFC9416].  Details regarding inter-domain
   segment routing (SR) are out of scope for this document.

   Internal vs. External:  An internal attacker in the context of SRv6
      is an attacker who is located within an SR domain.  Specifically,
      an internal attacker either has access to a node in the SR domain,
      or is located within the premises of the SR domain.  External
      attackers, on the other hand, are not within the SR domain.

   On-path vs. Off-path:  On-path attackers are located in a position
      that allows interception, modification or dropping of in-flight
      packets, as well as insertion (generation) of packets.  Off-path
      attackers can only attack by insertion of packets.

   Data plane vs. control plane vs. Management plane:  Attacks can be
      classified based on the plane they target: data, control, or
      management.  The distinction between on-path and off-path
      attackers depends on the plane where the attack occurs.  For
      instance, an attacker might be off-path from a data plane
      perspective but on-path from a control plane perspective.

   The following figure depicts an example of an SR domain with five
   attacker types, labeled 1-5.  As an example, attacker 2 is located
   along the path between the SR ingress node and SR endpoint 1, and is
   therefore an on-path attacker both in the data plane and in the
   control plane.  Thus, attacker 2 can listen, insert, delete, modify
   or replay data plane and/or control plane packets in transit.  Off-
   path attackers, such as attackers 4 and 5, can insert packets, and in
   some cases can passively listen to some traffic, such as multicast
   transmissions.  In this example a Path Computation Element as a
   Central Controller (PCECC) [RFC9050] is used as part of the control
   plane.  Thus, attacker 3 is an internal on-path attacker in the
   control plane, as it is located along the path between the PCECC and
   SR endpoint 1.

              node                                       node

                   Figure 1: Threat Model Taxonomy

   As defined in [RFC8402], SR operates within a "trusted domain".
   Therefore, in the current threat model the SR domain defines the
   boundary that distinguishes internal from external threats.
   Specifically, an attack on one domain that is invoked from within a
   different domain is considered an external attack in the context of
   the current document.

5.  Effect

   One of the important aspects of threat analysis is assessing the
   potential effect or outcome of each threat.  SRv6 allows for the
   forwarding of IPv6 packets via predetermined SR policies, which
   determine the paths and the processing of these packets.  An attack
   on SRv6 may cause packets to traverse arbitrary paths and to be
   subject to arbitrary processing by SR endpoints within an SR domain.
   This may allow an attacker to perform a number of attacks on the
   victim networks and hosts that would be mostly unfeasible for a non-
   SRv6 environment.

   The threat model in [ANSI-Sec] classifies threats according to their
   potential effect, defining six categories.  For each of these
   categories we briefly discuss its applicability to SRv6 attacks.

   *  Unauthorized Access: an attack that results in unauthorized access
      might be achieved by having an attacker leverage SRv6 to
      circumvent security controls as a result of security devices that
      are unable to enforce security policies for SRv6.  For example,
      this can occur if packets are directed through paths where packet
      filtering policies are not enforced, or if some security policies
      are not enforced in the presence of IPv6 Extension Headers.

   *  Masquerade: various attacks that result in spoofing or
      masquerading are possible in IPv6 networks.  However, these
      attacks are not specific to SRv6, and are therefore not within the
      scope of this document.

   *  System Integrity: attacks on SRv6 can manipulate the path and the
      processing that the packet is subject to, thus compromising the
      integrity of the system.  Furthermore, an attack that compromises
      the control plane and/or the management plane is also a means of
      affecting the system integrity.  Specific SRv6-targeted attack may
      cause one or more of the following outcomes:

      -  Avoiding a specific node or path: when an SRv6 policy is
         manipulated, specific nodes or paths may be bypassed, for
         example in order to avoid the billing service or circumvent
         access controls and security filters.

      -  Preferring a specific path: packets can be manipulated so that
         they are diverted to a specific path.  This can result in
         allowing various unauthorized services such as traffic
         acceleration.  Alternatively, an attacker can divert traffic to
         be forwarded through a specific node that the attacker has
         access to, which facilitates more complex on-path attacks such
         as passive listening, recon and various man-in-the-middle
         attacks.

      -  Causing header modifications: SRv6 network programming
         determines the SR endpoint behavior, including potential header
         modifications.  Thus, one of the potential outcomes of an
         attack is unwanted header modifications.

   *  Communication Integrity: SRv6 attacks may cause packets to be
      forwarded through paths that the attacker controls, which may
      facilitate other attacks that compromise the integrity of user
      data.  Integrity protection of user data, which is implemented in
      higher layers, avoids these aspects, and therefore communication
      integrity is not within the scope of this document.

   *  Confidentiality: as in communication integrity, packets forwarded
      through unintended paths may traverse nodes controlled by the
      attacker.  Since eavesdropping of user data can be avoided by
      using encryption in higher layers, it is not within the scope of
      this document.  However, eavesdropping of a network that uses SRv6
      is a specific form of reconnaissance.  This reconnaissance allows
      the attacker to collect information about SR endpoint addresses,
      SR policies, and network topologies.

   *  Denial of Service: the availability aspects of SRv6 include the
      ability of attackers to leverage SRv6 as a means for compromising
      the performance of a network or for causing Denial of Service
      (DoS), including:

      -  Resource exhaustion: compromising the availability of the
         system can be achieved by sending SRv6-enabled packets to/
         through victim nodes in a way that results in a negative
         performance impact of the victim systems (e.g., [RFC9098]).
         For example, network programming can be used in some cases to
         manipulate segment endpoints to perform unnecessary functions
         that consume processing resources.  Resource exhaustion may in
         severe cases cause Denial of Service (DoS).

      -  Forwarding loops: an attacker might achieve attack
         amplification by increasing the number hops that each packet is
         forwarded through and thus increase the load on the network.
         For instance, a set of SIDs can be inserted in a way that
         creates a forwarding loop ([RFC8402], [RFC5095],
         [CanSecWest2007]) and thus loads the nodes along the loop.

      -  Causing packets to be discarded: an attacker may cause a packet
         to be forwarded to a point in the network where it can no
         longer be forwarded, causing the packet to be discarded.

   Section 6 discusses specific implementations of these attacks, and
   possible mitigations are discussed in Section 7.

6.  Attacks

6.1.  Attack Abstractions

   Packet manipulation and processing attacks can be implemented by
   performing a set of one or more basic operations.  These basic
   operations (abstractions) are as follows:

   *  Passive listening: an attacker who reads packets off the network
      can collect information about SR endpoint addresses, SR policies
      and the network topology.  This information can then be used to
      deploy other types of attacks.

   *  Packet replaying: in a replay attack the attacker records one or
      more packets and transmits them at a later point in time.  This
      could lead to using more resources or security devices being
      unable to track connections correctly.

   *  Packet insertion: an attacker generates and injects a packet to
      the network.  The generated packet may be maliciously crafted to
      include false information; including false addresses, SRv6-related
      information, or other intentionally incorrect information.

   *  Packet deletion: by intercepting and removing packets from the
      network, an attacker prevents these packets from reaching their
      destination.  Selective removal of packets may, in some cases,
      cause more severe damage than random packet loss.

   *  Packet modification: the attacker modifies packets during transit.

   This section describes attacks that are based on packet manipulation
   and processing, as well as attacks performed by other means.  While
   it is possible for packet manipulation and processing attacks against
   all the fields of the IPv6 header and its extension headers, this
   document limits itself to the IPv6 header and the SRH.

6.2.  Data Plane Attacks

6.2.1.  Modification Attack

6.2.1.1.  Overview

   An on-path internal attacker can modify a packet while it is in
   transit in a way that directly affects the packet's segment list.

   A modification attack can be performed in one or more of the
   following ways:

   *  SID list: the SRH can be manipulated by adding or removing SIDs,
      or by modifying existing SIDs.

   *  IPv6 Destination Address (DA): when an SRH is present modifying
      the destination address (DA) of the IPv6 header affects the active
      segment.  However, DA modification can affect the SR policy even
      in the absence of an SRH.  One example is modifying a DA which is
      used as a Binding SID [RFC8402].  Another example is modifying a
      DA which represents a compressed segment list [RFC9800].  SRH
      compression allows encoding multiple compressed SIDs within a
      single 128-bit SID, and thus modifying the DA can affect one or
      more hops in the SR policy.

   *  Add/remove SRH: an attacker can insert or remove an SRH.

   *  SRH TLV: adding, removing or modifying TLV fields in the SRH.

   It is noted that the SR modification attack is performed by an on-
   path attacker who has access to packets in transit, and thus can
   implement these attacks directly.  However, SR modification is
   relatively easy to implement and requires low processing resources by
   an attacker, while it facilitates more complex on-path attacks by
   redirecting the traffic to another node that the attacker has access
   to with more processing resources.

   An on-path internal attacker can also modify, insert, or delete other
   extension headers but these are outside the scope of this document.

6.2.1.2.  Scope

   An SR modification attack can be performed by on-path attackers.  If
   filtering is deployed at the domain boundaries as described in
   Section 7.1, the ability to implement SR modification attacks is
   limited to on-path internal attackers.

6.2.1.3.  Effect

   SR modification attacks, including adding or removing an SRH,
   modifying the SID list, and modifying the IPv6 DA, can have one or
   more of the following outcomes, which are described in Section 5.

   *  Unauthorized access

   *  Avoiding a specific node or path

   *  Preferring a specific path

   *  Causing header modifications

   *  Causing packets to be discarded

   *  Resource exhaustion

   *  Forwarding loops

   Maliciously adding unnecessary TLV fields can cause further resource
   exhaustion.

6.2.2.  Passive Listening

6.2.2.1.  Overview

   An on-path internal attacker can passively listen to packets and
   specifically listen to the SRv6-related information that is conveyed
   in the IPv6 header and the SRH.  This approach can be used for
   reconnaissance, i.e., for collecting segment lists.

6.2.2.2.  Scope

   A reconnaissance attack is limited to on-path internal attackers.

   If filtering is deployed at the domain boundaries (Section 7.1), it
   prevents any leaks of explicit SRv6 routing information through the
   boundaries of the administrative domain.  In this case, external
   attackers can only collect SRv6-related data in a malfunctioning
   network in which SRv6-related information is leaked through the
   boundaries of an SR domain.

6.2.2.3.  Effect

   While the information collected in a reconnaissance attack does not
   compromise the confidentiality of the user data, it allows an
   attacker to gather information about the network which in turn can be
   used to enable other attacks.

6.2.3.  Packet Insertion

6.2.3.1.  Overview

   In a packet insertion attack packets are inserted (injected) into the
   network with a segment list.  The attack can be applied either by
   using synthetic packets or by replaying previously recorded packets.

6.2.3.2.  Scope

   Packet insertion can be performed by either on-path or off-path
   attackers.  In the case of a replay attack, recording packets in-
   flight requires on-path access and the recorded packets can later be
   injected either from an on-path or an off-path location.

   If filtering is deployed at the domain boundaries (Section 7.1),
   insertion attacks can only be implemented by internal attackers.

6.2.3.3.  Effect

   The main effect of this attack is resource exhaustion, which
   compromises the availability of the network, as described in
   Section 6.2.1.3.

6.2.4.  Other Attacks

   Various attacks which are not specific to SRv6 can be used to
   compromise networks that deploy SRv6.  For example, spoofing is not
   specific to SRv6, but can be used in a network that uses SRv6.  Such
   attacks are outside the scope of this document.

   Because SRv6 is completely reliant on IPv6 for addressing,
   forwarding, and fundamental networking basics, it is potentially
   subject to any existing or emerging IPv6 vulnerabilities [RFC9099].
   This, however, is out of scope for this document.

6.3.  Control Plane Attacks

6.3.1.  Overview

   The SRv6 control plane leverages existing control plane protocols,
   such as BGP, IS-IS, OSPF and PCEP.  Consequently, any security
   attacks that can potentially compromise these protocols are also
   applicable to SRv6 deployments utilizing them.  Therefore, this
   document does not provide an exhaustive list of the potential control
   plane attacks.  Instead, it highlights key categories of attacks,
   focusing on three primary areas: attacks targeting routing protocols,
   centralized control plane infrastructures, and OAM protocols.  In
   this document, the term OAM refers specifically to Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance, in alignment with the definition
   provided in [RFC6291].  As such, it explicitly excludes management-
   related functions.  Security considerations pertaining to the
   management plane are addressed in Section 6.4.

6.3.2.  Routing Protocol Attacks

6.3.2.1.  Overview

   Generic threats applicable to routing protocols are discussed in
   [RFC4593].  Similar to data plane attacks, the abstractions outlined
   in Section 6.1 are also applicable to control plane traffic.  These
   include passive eavesdropping, message injection, replay, deletion,
   and modification.

   Passive listening enables an attacker to intercept routing protocol
   messages as they traverse the network.  This form of attack does not
   alter the content of the messages but allows the adversary to analyze
   routing information, infer network topology, and gather intelligence
   on routing behavior.

   Active attacks involve the unauthorized injection or alteration of
   control plane messages.  Such attacks can compromise routing
   integrity by introducing falsified information, modifying legitimate
   routing data, or triggering incorrect forwarding decisions.  These
   disruptions may result in denial-of-service conditions or traffic
   misdirection.

   For example, an attacker may advertise falsified SIDs to manipulate
   SR policies.  Another example in the context of SRv6 is the
   advertisement of an incorrect Maximum SID Depth (MSD) value
   [RFC8476].  If the advertised MSD is lower than the actual
   capability, path computation may fail to compute a viable path.
   Conversely, if the value is higher than supported, an attempt to
   instantiate a path that can't be supported by the head-end (the node
   performing the SID imposition) may occur.

   An additional case could be the manipulation of backup paths
   [RFC8355], where the attacker could alter the SIDs defining such
   backup path then directing traffic over suboptimal or compromised
   paths, enabling eavesdropping, traffic analysis, or selective denial
   of service, compromising the service integrity and confidentiality if
   traffic is diverted to unauthorized nodes or paths.

   Finally, in situations of interworking with other domains, as for BGP
   Egress Peer Engineering (BGP-EPE) [RFC9087] an attacker injecting
   malicious BGP-EPE policies may steer traffic through unauthorized
   peers or paths.  This facilitates interception, traffic analysis, or
   denial of service.  Attackers gaining access to the BGP-EPE
   controller can manipulate SRv6 route selection and segment lists,
   compromising network integrity and confidentiality.

6.3.2.2.  Scope

   The location of an attacker in the network significantly affects the
   scope of potential attacks.  Off-path attackers are generally limited
   to injecting malicious routing messages, while on-path attackers can
   perform a broader range of attacks, including active modification, or
   passive listening.

6.3.2.3.  Effect

   Attacks targeting the routing protocol can have diverse impacts on
   network operation, including the aspects described in Section 5.
   These impacts may include incorrect SR policies or the degradation of
   network availability, potentially resulting in service disruption or
   denial of service.

6.3.3.  OAM Attacks

6.3.3.1.  Overview

   Since SRv6 operates over an IPv6 infrastructure, existing OAM
   protocols designed for IPv6 networks are applicable to SRv6 as well.
   Consequently, the security considerations associated with
   conventional IPv6 OAM protocols are also relevant to SRv6
   environments.  As noted in [RFC7276], successful attacks on OAM
   protocols can mislead operators by simulating non-existent failures
   or by concealing actual network issues.  SRv6-specific OAM aspects
   are specified in [RFC9259].

   The O-flag in the SRH serves as a marking bit in user packets to
   trigger telemetry data collection and export at the segment
   endpoints.  An attacker may exploit this mechanism by setting the
   O-flag in transit packets, thereby overloading the control plane and
   degrading system availability.  Additionally, an on-path attacker may
   passively intercept OAM data exported to external analyzers,
   potentially gaining unauthorized insight into network topology and
   behavior.

6.3.3.2.  Scope

   Off-path attackers may attempt to degrade system availability by
   injecting fabricated OAM messages or SRv6 packets with the O-bit set,
   thereby triggering unnecessary telemetry processing.  They may also
   probe SRv6 nodes to infer information about network state and
   performance characteristics.

   On-path attackers possess enhanced capabilities due to their position
   within the traffic path.  These include passive interception of OAM
   data, unauthorized modification of the O-bit in transit packets, and
   tampering with legitimate OAM messages to mislead network monitoring
   systems or conceal operational issues.

6.3.3.3.  Effect

   Attacks targeting OAM protocols may impact network availability or
   facilitate unauthorized information gathering.  Such attacks can
   disrupt normal operations or expose sensitive details about network
   topology, performance, or state.

6.3.4.  Central Control Plane Attacks

6.3.4.1.  Overview

   Centralized control plane architectures, such as those based on the
   Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] and PCE as a Central
   Controller (PCECC) [RFC8283], inherently introduce a single point of
   failure.  This centralization may present a security vulnerability,
   particularly with respect to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
   targeting the controller.  Furthermore, the central controller
   becomes a focal point for potential interception or manipulation of
   control messages exchanged with individual Network Elements (NEs),
   thereby increasing the risk of compromise to the overall network
   control infrastructure.

6.3.4.2.  Scope

   As with other control plane attacks, an off-path attacker may attempt
   to inject forged control messages or impersonate a legitimate
   controller.  On-path attackers, by virtue of their position within
   the communication path, possess additional capabilities such as
   passive interception of control traffic and in-transit modification
   of messages exchanged between the controller and Network Elements
   (NEs).

   For example, an attacker may manipulate SR policies instantiated via
   the central controller (using protocols like PCEP or BGP) at the head
   end, thereby altering both the paths of the SR policy and the traffic
   steered over it.  Additionally, PCECC enables manipulation of SID
   allocation and distribution.

6.3.4.3.  Effect

   A successful attack may result in any of the adverse effects
   described in Section 5, potentially impacting availability and
   operational correctness.

6.4.  Management Plane Attacks

6.4.1.  Overview

   Similar to the control plane, a compromised management plane can
   enable a broad range of attacks, including unauthorized manipulation
   of SR policies and disruption of network availability.  The specific
   threats and their potential impact are influenced by the management
   protocols in use.

   As with centralized control systems, a centralized management
   infrastructure may introduce a single point of failure, rendering it
   susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or making it a target
   for eavesdropping and message tampering.

   Unauthorized access in a network management system can enable
   attackers or unprivileged users to gain control over network devices
   and alter configurations.  In SRv6-enabled environments, this can
   result in the manipulation of segment routing policies or cause
   denial-of-service (DoS) conditions by disrupting traffic or tampering
   with forwarding behavior.

   Management functionality is often defined using YANG data models,
   such as those specified in [RFC9020], [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-yang]
   and [I-D.ietf-lsr-ospf-srv6-yang].  As with any YANG module, data
   nodes marked as writable, creatable, or deletable may be considered
   sensitive in certain operational environments.  Unauthorized or
   unprotected write operations (e.g., via edit-config) targeting these
   nodes can adversely affect network operations.  Some of the readable
   data nodes in a YANG module may also be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.

6.4.1.1.  Scope

   As with control plane attacks, an off-path attacker may attempt to
   inject forged management messages or impersonate a legitimate network
   management system.  On-path attackers, due to their privileged
   position within the communication path, have additional capabilities
   such as passive interception of management traffic and unauthorized
   modification of messages in transit.  An attacker with unauthorized
   access to a management system can cause significant damage, depending
   on the scope of the system and the strength of the access control
   mechanisms in place.

6.4.1.2.  Effect

   A successful attack may result in any of the adverse effects
   described in Section 5, potentially impacting availability and
   operational correctness.

6.5.  Attacks - Summary

7.  Mitigation Methods

   This section presents methods that can be used to mitigate the
   threats and issues that were presented in previous sections.  This
   section does not introduce new security solutions or protocols.

7.1.  Trusted Domains and Filtering

7.1.1.  Overview

   As specified in [RFC8402]:

    By default, SR operates within a trusted domain.  Traffic MUST be
    filtered at the domain boundaries.
    The use of best practices to reduce the risk of tampering within the
    trusted domain is important.  Such practices are discussed in
    [RFC4381] and are applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6.

   Following the spirit of [RFC8402], the current document assumes that
   SRv6 is deployed within a trusted domain.  Traffic MUST be filtered
   at the domain boundaries.  Thus, most of the attacks described in
   this document are limited to within the domain (i.e., internal
   attackers).

   Such an approach has been commonly referred to as the concept of
   "fail-open", a state of which the attributes are frequently described
   as containing inherently more risk than fail-closed methodologies.
   The reliance of perfectly crafted filters on on all edges of the
   trusted domain pose a demonstrable risk of inbound or outbound leaks
   if the filters are removed or adjusted in an erroneous manner.  It is
   also important to note that some filtering implementations have
   limits on the size, complexity, or protocol support that can be
   applied, which may prevent the filter adjustments or creation
   required to properly secure the trusted domain for a new protocol
   such as SRv6.

   Practically speaking, this means successfully enforcing a "Trusted
   Domain" may be operationally difficult and error-prone in practice,
   and that attacks that are expected to be unfeasible from outside the
   trusted domain may actually become feasible when any of the involved
   systems fails to enforce the filtering policy that is required to
   define the Trusted Domain.

7.1.2.  SRH Filtering

   Filtering can be performed based on the presence of an SRH.  More
   generally, [RFC9288] provides recommendations on the filtering of
   IPv6 packets containing IPv6 extension headers at transit routers.
   However, filtering based on the presence of an SRH is not necessarily
   useful for two reasons: 1.  The SRH is optional for SID processing as
   described in [RFC8754] section 3.1 and 4.1. 2.  A packet containing
   an SRH may not be destined to the SR domain, it may be simply
   transiting the domain.

   For these reasons SRH filtering is not necessarily a useful method of
   mitigation.

7.1.3.  Address Range Filtering

   The IPv6 destination address can be filtered at the SR ingress node
   and at all nodes implementing SRv6 SIDs within the SR domain in order
   to mitigate external attacks.  Section 5.1 of [RFC8754] describes
   this in detail and a summary is presented here: 1.  At ingress nodes,
   any packet entering the SR domain and destined to a SID within the SR
   domain is dropped. 2.  At every SRv6 enabled node, any packet
   destined to a SID instantiated at the node from a source address
   outside the SR domain is dropped.

   In order to apply such a filtering mechanism the SR domain needs to
   have an infrastructure address range for SIDs and an infrastructure
   address range for source addresses that can be detected and enforced.
   Some examples of an infrastructure address range for SIDs are: 1.
   ULA addresses 2.  The prefix defined in [RFC9602] 3.  GUA addresses

   Many operators reserve a /64 block for all loopback addresses and
   allocate /128 for each loopback interface.  This simplifies the
   filtering of permitted source addresses.

   Failure to implement address range filtering at ingress nodes is
   mitigated with filtering at SRv6 enabled nodes.  Failure to implement
   both filtering mechanisms could result in a "fail open" scenario,
   where some attacks by internal attackers described in this document
   may be launched by external attackers.

   Filtering on prefixes has been shown to be useful, specifically
   [RFC8754]'s description of packet filtering.  There are no known
   limitations with filtering on infrastructure addresses, and [RFC9099]
   expands on the concept with control plane filtering.

7.2.  Encapsulation of Packets

   Packets steered in an SR domain are often contained in an IPv6
   encapsulation.  Encapsulation of packets at the SR ingress node and
   decapsulation at the SR egress node mitigates the ability of external
   attackers to attack the domain and also allows for encapsulation of
   both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.

7.3.  Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)

   The SRH can be secured by an HMAC TLV, as defined in [RFC8754].  The
   HMAC is an optional TLV that secures the segment list, the SRH flags,
   the SRH Last Entry field and the IPv6 source address.  A pre-shared
   key is used in the generation and verification of the HMAC.

   Using an HMAC in an SR domain can mitigate some of the SR
   Modification Attacks (Section 6.2.1).

   The following aspects of the HMAC should be considered:

   *  The HMAC TLV is OPTIONAL.

   *  While it is presumed that unique keys will be employed by each
      participating node, in scenarios where the network resorts to
      manual configuration of pre-shared keys, the same key might be
      reused by multiple systems as an incorrect shortcut to keeping the
      problem of pre-shared key configuration manageable.

   *  When the HMAC is used there is a distinction between an attacker
      who becomes internal by having physical access, for example by
      plugging into an active port of a network device, and an attacker
      who has full access to a legitimate network node, including for
      example encryption keys if the network is encrypted.  The latter
      type of attacker is an internal attacker who can perform any of
      the attacks that were described in the previous section as
      relevant to internal attackers.

   *  An internal attacker who does not have access to the pre-shared
      key can capture legitimate packets, and later replay the SRH and
      HMAC from these recorded packets.  This allows the attacker to
      insert the previously recorded SRH and HMAC into a newly injected
      packet.  An on-path internal attacker can also replace the SRH of
      an in-transit packet with a different SRH that was previously
      captured.

   These considerations limit the extent to which HMAC TLV can be relied
   upon as a security mechanism that could readily mitigate threats
   associated with spoofing and tampering protection for the IPv6 SRH.

7.4.  Control Plane Mitigation Methods

   Mitigation strategies for control plane attacks depend heavily on the
   specific protocols in use.  Since these protocols are not exclusive
   to SRv6, this section does not attempt to provide an exhaustive list
   of mitigation techniques.  Instead, it is focused on considerations
   particularly relevant to SRv6 deployments.

   Routing protocols can employ authentication and/or encryption to
   protect against modification, injection, and replay attacks, as
   outlined in [RFC6518].  These mechanisms are essential for
   maintaining the integrity and authenticity of control plane
   communications.

   In centralized SRv6 control plane architectures, such as those
   described in [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp], it is
   RECOMMENDED that communication between PCEs and PCCs be secured using
   authenticated and encrypted sessions.  This is typically achieved
   using Transport Layer Security (TLS), following the guidance in
   [RFC8253] and best practices in [RFC9325].

   When the O-flag is used for Operations, Administration, and
   Maintenance (OAM) functions, as defined in [RFC9259], implementations
   should enforce rate limiting to mitigate potential denial-of-service
   (DoS) attacks triggered by excessive control plane signaling.

   The control plane should be confined to a trusted administrative
   domain.  As specified in [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ls-sr-policy], SR Policy
   information advertised via BGP should be restricted to authorized
   nodes, controllers, and applications within this domain.  Similarly,
   the use of the O-flag is assumed to occur only within such a trusted
   environment, where the risk of abuse is minimized.

7.5.  Management Plane Mitigation Methods

   Mitigating attacks on the management plane, much like in the control
   plane, depends on the specific protocols and interfaces employed.

   Management protocols such as NETCONF and RESTCONF are commonly used
   to configure and monitor SRv6-enabled devices.  These protocols must
   be secured to prevent unauthorized access, configuration tampering,
   or information leakage.

   The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   SRv6-specific YANG modules should be designed with the same security
   considerations applied to all YANG-based models.  Writable nodes must
   be protected using access control mechanisms such as NACM and secured
   transport protocols like SSH or TLS to prevent unauthorized
   configuration changes.  Readable nodes that expose sensitive
   operational data should be access-controlled and transmitted only
   over encrypted channels to mitigate the risk of information leakage.

8.  Implications on Existing Equipment

8.1.  Middlebox Filtering Issues

   When an SRv6 packet is forwarded in the SRv6 domain, its destination
   address changes constantly and the real destination address is
   hidden.  Security devices on SRv6 network may not learn the real
   destination address and fail to perform access control on some SRv6
   traffic.

   The security devices on SRv6 networks need to take care of SRv6
   packets.  However, SRv6 packets are often encapsulated by an SR
   ingress device with an IPv6 encapsulation that has the loopback
   address of the SR ingress device as a source address.  As a result,
   the address information of SR packets may be asymmetric, resulting in
   improper traffic filter problems, which affects the effectiveness of
   security devices.  For example, along the forwarding path in SRv6
   network, the SR-aware firewall will check the association
   relationships of the bidirectional VPN traffic packets.  It is
   therefore able to retrieve the final destination of an SRv6 packet
   from the last entry in the SRH.  When the <source, destination> tuple
   of the packet from PE1 (Provider Edge 1) to PE2 is <PE1-IP-ADDR, PE2-
   VPN-SID>, and the other direction is <PE2-IP-ADDR, PE1-VPN-SID>, the
   source address and destination address of the forward and backward
   traffic are regarded as different flows.  Thus, legitimate traffic
   may be blocked by the firewall.

   Forwarding SRv6 traffic through devices that are not SRv6-aware might
   in some cases lead to unpredictable behavior.  Because of the
   existence of the SRH, and the additional headers, security
   appliances, monitoring systems, and middle boxes could react in
   different ways if they do not incorporate support for the supporting
   SRv6 mechanisms, such as the IPv6 Segment Routing Header (SRH)
   [RFC8754].  Additionally, implementation limitations in the
   processing of IPv6 packets with extension headers may result in SRv6
   packets being dropped [RFC7872],[RFC9098].

   Upper-layer checksum calculations rely on a pseudo-header that
   includes the IPv6 Destination Address.  [RFC8200] specifies that when
   the Routing header is present the upper-layer checksum is computed by
   the originating node based on the IPv6 address of the last element of
   the Routing header.  When compressed segment lists [RFC9800] are
   used, the last element of the Routing header may be different than
   the Destination Address as received by the final destination.
   Furthermore, compressed segment lists can be used in the Destination
   Address without the presence of a Routing header, and in this case
   the IPv6 Destination address can be modified along the path.  As
   defined in [RFC9800], the Destination Address used in the upper-layer
   checksum calculation is the address as expected to be received by the
   ultimate destination.  As a result, some existing middleboxes which
   verify the upper-layer checksum might miscalculate the checksum.

8.2.  Limited capability hardware

   In some cases, access control list capabilities are a resource shared
   with other features across a given hardware platform.  Filtering
   capabilities should be considered along with other hardware reliant
   functions such as VLAN scale, route table size, MAC address table
   size, etc.  Filtering both at the control and data plane may or may
   not require shared resources.  For example, some platforms may
   require allocating resources from route table size in order to
   accommodate larger numbers of access lists.  Hardware and software
   configurations should be considered when designing the filtering
   capabilities for an SRv6 control and data plane.

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of SRv6 are presented throughout this
   document.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

11.  Topics for Further Consideration

   This section lists topics that will be discussed further before
   deciding whether they need to be included in this document, as well
   as some placeholders for items that need further work.

   *  The following references may be used in the future: RFC9256
      [RFC8986]

   *  SRH compression

   *  Spoofing

   *  Path enumeration

   *  host to host scenario involving a WAN and/or a data center fabric.

   *  Terms that may be used in a future version: Locator Block, FRR,
      uSID

   *  L4 checksum: [RFC8200] specifies that when the Routing header is
      present the L4 checksum is computed by the originating node based
      on the IPv6 address of the last element of the Routing header.
      When compressed segment lists [RFC9800] are used, the last element
      of the Routing header may be different than the Destination
      Address as received by the final destination.  Furthermore,
      compressed segment lists can be used in the Destination Address
      without the presence of a Routing header.  In this case the IPv6
      Destination address can be modified along the path.  As a result,
      some existing middleboxes which verify the L4 checksum might
      miscalculate the checksum.  This issue is currently under
      discussion in the SPRING WG.

   *  Segment Routing Header figure: the SRv6 Segment Routing Header
      (SRH) is defined in [RFC8754].
